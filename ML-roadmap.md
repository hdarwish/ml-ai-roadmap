# The Distinguished ML & Gen AI Engineer: A 52-Week Roadmap

### The Philosophy: Building a Distinguished Engineer

This plan is a marathon, not a sprint. Your software engineering background is your launchpad. We will augment it with a deep, first-principles understanding of ML, moving from mathematical theory to production-grade systems.

### Guiding Principles & Daily Habits (The Keys to Success)

*   **Active Recall & Spaced Repetition:** Every Sunday, spend 30 minutes quizzing yourself on last week’s topics *from memory* before checking notes. Use a tool like **Anki** for flashcards of key formulas and definitions; review for 5-10 minutes daily.
*   **The Daily Split:** Structure your learning time for maximum retention. A good target is:
    *   **60 min:** Theory (reading, videos, math).
    *   **90 min:** Practice (coding, experiments, projects).
    *   **30 min:** Community (reading discussions, paper summaries, blogs).
*   **Teach to Learn:** Every Sunday evening, write a public "Week in Review" post on a blog or your project's GitHub `README.md`. Explaining a concept is the ultimate test of understanding.
*   **Find a Mentor:** Once a month, try to have a 30-minute "office hours" call with a senior ML practitioner. This provides invaluable real-world context.
*   **Keep a "Gotchas.md" File:** Maintain a running log of tricky bugs, counter-intuitive results, and hard-won lessons. This will become your personal knowledge base.
